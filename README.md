In this text analytics coursework, two main tasks were undertaken: emotion classification in tweets and named entity recognition in scientific articles. Both neural and non-neural methods were implemented and evaluated for classifying emotions using the TweetEval dataset, while a sequence tagger was designed for identifying chemicals and diseases in biomedical texts using the Bio Creative V dataset. Data preprocessing, feature selection, model implementation, performance evaluation, and result analysis were performed for both tasks. Topic identification in emotional tweets and word similarity techniques for disease entities were also explored.
